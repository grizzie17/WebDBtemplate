<p>Let’s talk about the calendar …</p>

<p>Once you have logged on you should come the “Home” page for 
the maintenance area.&nbsp; You will see a set of tabs across the top and some 
links on the home page.&nbsp; I’ll talk about the tabs and the like in a later 
email, for right now, I want to direct your attention to the first grouping of 
links; specifically the “Calendar” link.&nbsp; The calendar serves as a very 
important part of your website, and if you keep it up to date, I think that you 
find that it is one of the main reasons that YOUR chapter members start visiting 
your site frequently.&nbsp; At first it will be like pulling teeth to get your 
members to go to the website, but all of a sudden you will find that they are 
using it more and more.&nbsp; For Chapter-B, it was the calendar that started 
pulling people in.&nbsp; We have even had people visit our chapter because of 
our website and our calendar!&nbsp; Okay, enough justification; when you click 
on the Calendar link it will open a new browser window.</p>

<p>The Calendar Maintenance page lists all of the events for a 
specific section (or quite literally a file).&nbsp; There is a drop-down list at 
the top of the page in the middle.&nbsp; The first entry that you will see is 
“Chapter events”.&nbsp; This section is for those events that you will enter as 
unique to a month.&nbsp; These are non-repeating events.&nbsp; They can actually 
be any kind of events that you want, but the way that I have structured things 
is that you have one section for events that you create and delete as each month 
rolls by.&nbsp; Then there is another section titled “Chapter eventz2” (okay I 
was tired when I came up with the name), for those chapter events that happen 
monthly or annually.&nbsp; Notice that I said “chapter events”, there is another 
section for district events.&nbsp; By the way when you select a different entry 
in the drop-down list the page automatically reloads with the corresponding 
calendar entries.&nbsp; Before I go into editing, I want to point out something 
that is pretty nice concerning the calendar.&nbsp; There are a bunch of the 
sections that you don’t have to worry about maintaining at all.&nbsp; They are 
automatically imported from the district calendar.&nbsp; If you select the 
“District Events” section from the drop-down list you will notice that the 
listing is a little bit different.&nbsp; First it doesn’t have any “edit” or 
“delete” links on the left-hand side and second it has a couple of extra lines 
of information above all of the calendar entries.&nbsp; The first states 
“Entries Imported from external source”, the second identifies that it came from 
the district web server <a href="http://Alabama-gwrra.org/">
http://Alabama-gwrra.org/</a> and that it pulled from the calendar section 
“district_events”, then it goes on to tell you that your copy will be 
automatically refreshed every 14 days and on the transition of the month.&nbsp; 
It is also worth mentioning that when you select the “Clear Cache” link on the 
maintenance home page that will also force the external calendar sections to be 
retrieved again.&nbsp; It is worth noting that just because these items show up 
in your calendar does not mean that your chapter has elected to participate.&nbsp; 
That is the reason that they are in a sort of gold/reference color.&nbsp; If you 
are going to participate you should still add an event to the “Chapter Events” 
section giving details about how your chapter is participating.</p>

<p>Now let’s go back to the “Chapter Events” section and click 
on the “Add New Event” link in the upper-left corner.&nbsp; I’m going to tell 
you about how “I” suggest using the calendar.&nbsp; In some cases you can do 
what you like, but in other cases you MUST do what I am talking about (I will 
try to remember to tell you when I am making a suggesting versus a rule).&nbsp;
</p>

<p>SUGGESTION: Most of the time I just use the Subject and 
Body fields for typing information about an event.&nbsp; I will usually do 
something like “Supper at Blah” or “Little River Canyon Ride” for the subject.&nbsp; 
The subject generally is short and to the point.&nbsp; The first thing that I 
usually put in the Body field is the Time that something will happen followed by 
a single dash and then the action that happens at that time.&nbsp; Such as 
“8:00am – Depart from Moores Mill/Shell” or “6:00pm – 123 University Pky”.&nbsp; 
By the way, I have found that if you identify times as “8:00am” instead of “8:00 
a.m.” things work a whole lot better.&nbsp; The reason is that you don’t have to 
worry about the “a.m.” or “p.m.” word-wrapping onto the next line without the 
time.&nbsp; And as long as you use a lowercase for your “am/pm” it still is very 
readable.</p>

<p>Just to let you know the difference between the different 
fields and what happens regarding the formatting:</p>

<p>Subject will be output using the style defined by the 
event.&nbsp; Body will follow the subject separated by a double dash (“ -- “) 
using the event style plus italic.&nbsp; Location will follow the Subject and 
Body enclosed within parenthesis using the event style.&nbsp; Comment will start 
a new line using the event style.</p>

<p>STRONG SUGGESTION: You really do need to specify a style 
for every event that you create.&nbsp; I have setup a pretty good range of 
styles that are setup to flag members as to what the event is.</p>

<p>MUST DO: Categories are not required, but if you specify a 
category they should always be lowercase.&nbsp; It also doesn’t make much sense 
to specify categories that you can’t search on … so the following are the 
categories that are used for the search tabs, the home page, or for the email 
notification.</p>

<p>(instead of al-z, substitute your chapter designation)</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Category</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>al-z</td>
		<td>(homepage and calendar page “AL-Z Events” tab)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>z-gathering&nbsp; </td>
		<td>(homepage)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>z-ride</td>
		<td>(calendar page “AL-Z Rides” tab)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>activity</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>charity</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>safety</td>
		<td>(calendar page “Education” tab)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>funday</td>
		<td>(calendar page – please note there is no space)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>meeting</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>rally</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>trip</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>external</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>breakfast</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>lunch</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>supper</td>
		<td>(calendar page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>birthday</td>
		<td>(calendar page and home page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>anniversary</td>
		<td>(calendar page and home page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>email</td>
		<td>(email notification)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>email2</td>
		<td>(email notification)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>newsletter</td>
		<td>(newsletter planning – ask me about this later)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>entertainment&nbsp; </td>
		<td>(ride meeting planning)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The categories are comma separated.</p>

<p>Then specify the flavor of date that you want/need.</p>

<p>SUGGESTION: I only specify a time in the time field for 
chapter events.&nbsp; Today, the time field is only used for sorting events 
within a single day.&nbsp; The way sorting works is that first any event that 
has a time specified is sorted (meaning all of those events will be listed first 
for that day), then you can look at your drop down list to get a feel for the 
order that things will get sorted by.</p>

<p>If you have a multi-day event, put the starting day as the 
event date, and then specify the duration.&nbsp; The duration includes the 
starting day.&nbsp; My suggestion on the &quot;Expand Duration View&quot; drop-down is to 
select &quot;Month at a Glance&quot; for any multi-day events.&nbsp; If you want to see 
the difference, try creating a couple of events with different Duration Views.&nbsp; 
Then look at them in the normal calendar tab (which is a List View) and the 
Month at a Glance to see the difference.</p>

<p>The last thing that I will say about the calendar for now 
is that when you change the calendar, you will frequently not see the changes on 
the homepage unless you remember to select &quot;Clear Cache&quot;.</p>
