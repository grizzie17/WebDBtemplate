I've told you a million times that adults are different! You have to be able to read them. You know what your trouble is? You just have to understand the adult mind. I can predict what the average adult will say or do in almost any given situation. This is a must if you are going to survive as a child! Now take grandma for instance... I can predict exactly what she will say in the following situation. You draw a picture and I'll draw a picture. Then you take the two pictures in and show them to grandma. Ask her which picture she thinks is the better... I predict that she will look at them and say "Why, I think they're both very nice."
