!!Aging

Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get old is when we're kids? If you're less than 10 years old, you're so excited about aging that you think in fractions.

"How old are you?" "I'm four {{style b i:and a half!}}" You're never {{i:thirty-six {{b:and a half}}}}. You're {{b:four and a half}}, {{b:going on five!}} That's the key.

You get into your teens, now they can't hold you back. You jump to the next number, or even a few ahead.

"How old are you?" "I'm {{b:gonna be}} 16!" You could be 13, but hey, you're {{i:gonna be}} 16! And then the greatest day of your life! You {{b:become}} 21. Even the words sound like a ceremony. YOU {{b:BECOME}} 21. YESSSS!!!

But then you {{b:turn}} 30. Oooohh, what happened there? Makes you sound like {{i:bad milk}}! He {{b:TURNED}}; we had to throw him out. There's no fun now, you're Just a sour-dumpling.. What's wrong? What's changed?

You {{b:BECOME}} 21, you {{b:TURN}} 30, then you're {{b:PUSHING}} 40. {{b:Whoa!}} Put on the brakes, it's all slipping away. Before you know it, you {{b:REACH}} 50 and your dreams are gone.

But! Wait!!! You {{b:MAKE it}} to 60. You didn't think you would!

So you {{b:BECOME}} 21, {{b:TURN}} 30, {{b:PUSH}} 40, and {{b:REACH}} 50 and {{b:make it}} to 60.

You've built up so much speed that you {{b:HIT}} 70! After that it's a day-by-day thing; you {{b:HIT}} Wednesday!

You {{b:get into! your}} 80's and every day is a complete cycle; you {{b:HIT}} lunch; you {{b:TURN}} 4:30; you {{b:REACH}} bedtime. And it doesn't end there. Into the 90s, you start going backwards; "I {{b:Was JUST}} 92."

Then a strange thing happens. If you make it over 100, you become a little kid again. "I'm 100 {{b:and a half!}}"

{{i:May you all make it to a healthy 100 {{b:and a half!!}}}}
