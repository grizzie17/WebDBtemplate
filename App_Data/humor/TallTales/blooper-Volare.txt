Chrysler Corp. built a compact Plymouth back a few years ago, which they named the "Volare", presumably "to fly" in Italian, as that was a popular song at the time. Someone in the body styling division decided, without consultation apparently, that an accent mark looked good on the "e". With that change, in Spanish it COULD mean "I will fly", but it could as well be translated as "I will explode".
