!!Strange but True

The most played song on American radio during the twentieth century was {{i:You've Lost That Loving Feeling}} which was written by Barry Mann, Phil Spector, and Cynthia Weil.  Although recorded by different artists, the song is the only one in history to be played over 8 million times on the radio. That amounts to about 45 years if the song was played back to back!  Three songs were played 7 million times: {{i:Never My Love, Yesterday}}, and {{i:Stand By Me}} (in that order).
