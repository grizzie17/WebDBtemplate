!!Strange but True

Everyone knows that spinach is loaded in iron and makes you stronger - Just look what it has done for Popeye's career.  Well, Popeye was wrong.  So were all of those parents that stuffed it down their kids' throats.  In reality, spinach has no more iron in it than any other vegetable.  This spinach misconception dates back to the 1950's when a food analyst made an error while calculating the iron in spinach.  His decimal place was off by one place, suggesting that spinach had ten times as much iron content than it really did.
