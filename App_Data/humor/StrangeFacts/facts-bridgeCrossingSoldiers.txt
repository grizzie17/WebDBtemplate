!!Strange but True

Two hundred and twenty six soldiers lost their lives way back in 1850 when they crossed a suspension bridge that spanned the Maine at Angers, France.  It turns out that they were all marching in step and had caused an increased resonance (vibration) to the bridge.  Ever since, troops are ordered to rout step (march out of step) when crossing a bridge.
