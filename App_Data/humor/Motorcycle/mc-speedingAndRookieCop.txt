!!Motorcycle Speeding

{{i:A rookie police officer pulled a biker over for speeding and had the following exchange:}}

Officer: May I see your driver's license?

Biker: I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my 5th DUI. 

Officer: May I see the owner's card for this vehicle?

Biker: It's not my bike. I stole it.

Officer: The motorcycle is stolen?

Biker: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's card in the tool bag when I was putting my gun in there.

Officer: There's a gun in the tool bag?

Biker: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the dude who owns  this bike and stuffed his dope in the saddle bags.

Officer: There's drugs in the saddle bags too?!?!? 

Biker: Yes, sir. 

{{i:Hearing this, the rookie immediately called his captain. The biker was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the biker to handle the tense situation:}}

Captain: Sir, can I see your license?

Biker: Sure. Here it is. 

{{i:It was valid.}}

Captain: Who's motorcycle is this?

Biker: It's mine, officer. Here's the registration.

Captain: Could you slowly open your tool bag so I can see if there's a gun in it?

Biker: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it. 

{{i:Sure enough, there was nothing in the tool bag.}}

Captain: Would you mind opening your saddle bags? I was told you said there's drugs in them.

Biker: No problem. 

{{i:The saddle bags were opened; no drugs.}}

Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole this motorcycle, had a gun in the tool bag, and that there were drugs in the saddle bags.

Biker: Yeah, I'll bet he told you I was speeding, too.
