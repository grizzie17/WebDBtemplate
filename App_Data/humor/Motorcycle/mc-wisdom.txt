1. Takeoffs are optional; Stopping is mandatory.
2. Never try to drive farther than your fuel will allow.
3. When in doubt, stay home. No one ever suffered major injuries from a head-on with a remote control.
4. There are good stops and there are great stops. Any stop you can walk away from is a good one. A great one, you can drive your wing away from.
5. Learn from the mistakes of others, you may not live through yours.
6. Your probability of survival is directly and inversely proportional to your angle and speed of arrival to the stopping object.  The higher the speed and closer to head-on, the less chance of survival.
7. Never let your Wing take you someplace your brain hasn't spent at least 15 seconds.
8. In the eternal conflict between objects of plastic and steel moving at speed and the ground, the ground has yet to loose.
9. Good judgement comes from experience. Unfortunately experience comes from bad judgement. See rule #3
10. Keep looking around  there's always something you missed.
11. Remember that gravity is not just a good idea, it's the law, and one that doesn't break easily.
12. Remember thy Co-rider for they are the bearers of great pleasure if you get it right and even greater suffering if you get it wrong.
