Two guys were roaring down the road on a motorcycle when the driver slowed up and pulled over. 

His leather jacket had a broken zipper, and he told his friend, "I can't drive anymore with the air hitting me in the chest like that."

"Just put the jacket on backwards." His friend advised. They continued down the road but around the next bend, they lost control and wiped out.

A nearby farmer came upon the accident and ran to call the police. They asked him, "Are they showing any signs of life?" 

"Well," the farmer explained, "the driver was until I turned his head around the right way!"
