!!!To Wave, or Not to Wave

I was sitting at an intersection the other day waiting on a stop light to turn.  What was obviously a new rider approached from my right and made a left turn through the intersection.  At about the mid-point he noticed me sitting there and must have felt compelled by the 'brotherhood-of-bikers' thing to wave.  His bike swerved, and though he recovered, he'd clearly had a very close call.  Although some are a bit tongue in cheek, it occurred to me that passing on a few guidelines on waving would be appropriate.  I hope you enjoy the list.

|Rider in or approaching an intersection.|Don't wave. A new rider may try to wave back.|
|Rider in heavy traffic.|Even if traffic is light in your direction, don't wave. Again, a new rider may try to wave back.|
|You are in heavy traffic.|Survival takes precedence over brotherhood-of-bikers protocol.|
|Kid on a moped.|Wave. It will make you both feel good.|
|Both you and another rider are stopped at an intersection.|You don't have to shift into neutral just to wave. A knowing nod is more appropriate.|
|Mountain roads.|Keep your hands on the controls.|
|Rider on a different brand bike.|Don't be a jerk. Wave. A Bike is a bike.|
|Mulitple riders in formation.|Let the leader wave. Your job is to maintain your spacing.|
|Rider overtaking you.|Wave just before you're passed.|
|Overtaking a rider.|Wave as you go by.|
|Beautiful day, wide country road, light traffic.|Wave at everyone. If you're not enjoying the day, sell your bike.|
|Rain.|Wave. If rain makes you miserable, take your car instead.|
|Hottie on the sidewalk.|Use caution if you have a backseater. On second thought, go ahead. Seeing your head bob up and down from the blows to your helmet will be quite entertaining.|
|Someone in a care waves to you.|Wave back. Doesn't matter if they ride or not, they are friendly.|
|Kids|ALWAYS wave.|
|Motorcycle police.|Wave if you want, but they don't usually wave back.|
|Approaching, or departing from, a motorcycling event.|Within one mile of the event, the 'brotherhood of bikers' requirement to wave is lifted, so give your arm a break.|
|You waved, but I didn't wave back.|Don't take it personally. I was adjusting the radio or GPS|

P.S. Wave at scooters. They are motorcycles as well.
