!!Nuns on a Motorcycle

A police officer pulled over two nuns riding on a motorcycle, and said to the rider, "Ma'am, you're driving much too slowly, could you please drive faster?"

And the nun says, "Oh, I saw the sign with the '21' and assumed the speed limit was 21 km/h."

The officer explains: "No ma'am, the speed limit is 70. The highway number is Interstate 21."  Then the police officer looked at the passenger and saw the other nun shaking like a leaf.  "Excuse me sister, but what's wrong with your passenger?"

"Oh, that's probably because we just got off Highway 205."
