!!A Brazilian

A university co-ed is watching the news with her boyfriend when the newscaster says, "Six Brazilian men die in a skydiving accident."

The co-ed started crying, and says to her boyfriend, "That's horrible."

Confused, the boyfriend says, "Yes dear, it is sad, but they were skydiving, and there is that risk involved."

After a few minutes, the co-ed, still sobbing, says, "How many is a Brazilian?"
