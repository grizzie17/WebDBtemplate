{{b:Football}}

A guy takes his girlfriend to a football game for the first time. After the game he asked his girlfriend how she liked the game.  "Oh, I really liked it," she said, "but I just couldn't understand though why they were killing each other for 25 cents."

"What do you mean?"

"All they kept screaming was: Get the quarter back!  Get the quarter back!"
