{{b:Seeing Eye Dogs}}

There's a guy with a Doberman Pinscher and a guy with a Chihuahua. The guy with the Doberman Pinscher says to the guy with a Chihuahua, "Let's go over to that restaurant and get something to eat." 

The guy with the Chihuahua says, "We can't go in there. We've got dogs with us." 

The guy with the Doberman Pinscher says, "Just follow my lead." They walk over to the restaurant, the guy with the Doberman Pinscher puts on a pair of dark glasses, and he starts to walk in. 

A guy at the door says, "Sorry, mac, no pets allowed." 

The guy with the Doberman Pinscher says, "You don't understand. This is my seeing-eye dog." 

The guy at the door says, "A Doberman Pinscher?"

He says, "Yes, they're using them now, they're very good."

The guy at the door says, "Come on in."

The guy with the Chihuahua figures, "What the heck," so he puts on a pair of dark glasses and starts to walk in. The guy at the door says, "Sorry, pal, no pets allowed." 

The guy with the Chihuahua says, "You don't understand. This is my seeing-eye dog." 

The guy at the door says, "A Chihuahua?"

The guy with the Chihuahua says, "You mean they gave me a Chihuahua?"
