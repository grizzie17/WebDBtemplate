!!How to Wash the Toilet
 
{{i:This was simply too much of a time saver not to share it with you.}}

1. Put both lids of the toilet up and add {{sup:1}}/{{sub:8}} cup of pet shampoo to the water in the bowl.
|
2. Pick up the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom.   
|
3. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close the lid. You may need to stand on the lid.
|
4. The cat will self agitate and make ample suds. Never mind the noises that come from the toilet, the cat is actually enjoying this.
|
5. Flush the toilet three or four times This provides a 'power-wash' and 'rinse'.
|
6. Have someone open the front door of your home. Be sure that there are no people between the bathroom and the front door.
|
7. Stand behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift the lid.
|
8. The cat will rocket out of the toilet, streak through the bathroom, and run outside where he will dry himself off.
|
9. Both the commode and the cat will be sparkling clean.
