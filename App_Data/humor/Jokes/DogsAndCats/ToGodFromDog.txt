!!To: GOD
From: The Dog

*Dear God: Is it on purpose our names are the same, only reversed?
*Dear God: Why do humans smell the flowers, but seldom, if ever, smell one another?
*Dear God: When we get to heaven, can we sit on your couch? Or is it still the same old story?
*Dear God: Why are there cars named after the jaguar, the cougar, the mustang, the colt, the stingray, and the rabbit, but not ONE named for a Dog? How often do you see a cougar riding around? We do love a nice ride! Would it be so hard to rename the 'Chrysler Eagle' the 'Chrysler Beagle'?
*Dear God: If a Dog barks his head off in the forest and no human hears him, is he still a bad Dog?
*Dear God: We Dogs can understand human verbal instructions, hand signals, whistles, horns, clickers, beepers, scent ID's, electromagnetic energy fields, and Frisbee flight paths. What do humans understand?
*Dear God: More meatballs, less spaghetti, please.
*Dear God: Are there mailmen in Heaven? If there are, will I have to apologize?
*Dear God: Let me give you a list of just some of the things I must remember to be a good Dog.
** I will not eat the cats' food before they eat it or after they throw it up.
** I will not roll on dead seagulls, fish, crabs, etc., just because I like the way they smell.
** The Litter Box is not a cookie jar.
** The sofa is not a 'face towel'.
** The garbage collector is not stealing our stuff.
