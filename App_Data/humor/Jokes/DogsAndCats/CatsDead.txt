A man goes on a 2-month business trip to Europe and leaves his cat with his brother. Three days before his return he calls his brother.

{{b:Brother 1:}} So how is my cat doing?
{{b:Brother 2:}} He's Dead

{{b:Brother 1:}} He's Dead! What do you mean He's Dead! I loved that cat. Couldn't you think of a nicer way to tell me! I'm leaving in 3 days. You could of broke me to the news easier. You could of told me today that she got out of the house or something. Then when I called before I left you could of told me, Well, we found her but she is up on the roof and we're having trouble getting her down. Then when I call you from the airport you could of told me, The Fire Department was there and scared her off the roof and the cat died when it hit the ground.
{{b:Brother 2:}} I'm sorry... you're right... that was insensitive I won't let it happen again.

{{b:Brother 1:}} Alright, alright, forget about it. Anyway, how is Mom doing?
{{b:Brother 2:}} She's up on the roof and we're having trouble getting her down.
