A man is trying to understand the nature of God and asked him: "God, how long is a million years to you?" 

God answered: "A million years is like a minute."

Then the man asked: "God, how much is a million dollars to you?" And God replied: "A million dollars is like a penny."

Finally the man asked: "God, could you give me a penny?" And God says: "In a minute".
