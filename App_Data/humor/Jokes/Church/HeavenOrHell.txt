{{b:Heaven or Hell...}}

An engineer dies and goes to heaven. When he reaches the pearly gates St. Peter tells him he is in the wrong place and sends him straight to hell. 

A few weeks later God calls Satan to see how things are going. 

Satan tells him "Hey it's great down here since you sent me the engineer. We've got air conditioning, swimming pools, everything a person would ever want - it's great!" 

God freaks out - "That was a mistake - send him right back!" 

Satan laughs, "No way. We're keeping him." 

God threatens, "I'll sue!" 

To which Satan replies: "Yeah right. Where are -YOU- going to get a lawyer??"
