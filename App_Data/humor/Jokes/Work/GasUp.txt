!!Gas Up

A young man just had his first customer, which turned out to be a BIG BURLY truck driver.

The young man walked up to the table where the truck driver was sitting and asked; "can I take your order sir?"

The truck driver replied, "sure kid I want three flat tires and two headlights."

The young man was very puzzled and said, "I beg your pardon?"

The truck driver said again, "look kid; I want three flat tires and two headlights."

The young man was still puzzled, but replied; "yes sir, whatever."

The young man then took the request to his boss who was the head cook. He told him about the truck driver's order, and that he wanted three flat tires and two headlights, "I think he's in the wrong place."

The head cook said, "I know what he wants, he wants three flap jacks and two eggs sunny side up; the truck driver is just trying to be smart, I know him."

The cook said to the waiter, "Here, take this bowl of beans, give it to him and say this..."

The truck driver said, "Listen kid, I didn't order this, I said I wanted three flat tires and two headlights."

The waiter replied, "Well sir, the head cook said while you wait for your parts, you can gas up!"
