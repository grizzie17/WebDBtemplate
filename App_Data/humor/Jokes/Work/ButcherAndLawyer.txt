!!Butcher & Lawyer

A butcher saw a Lawyer passing by his shop one day, and asked him: Attorney, what would you do if a dog came in and stole your meat?

Lawyer replied: why? of course, I'll make the owner pay for it!

The Butcher said: If that is so, now you owe me $15 because it is your dog.

The Lawyer replied: very well, just deduct the $15 from the $25 you owe me for the advice, I'll collect the remaining $10 the next time I pass by here.
