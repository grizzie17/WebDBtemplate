!!!Clean House?

* Martha Stewart doesn't live here!!
|
* I'm creative; you can't expect me to be neat, too!
|
* Ring Bell for Maid Service. If no answer, do it yourself!
|
* You may touch the dust in this house, but please don't write in it!
|
* If you write in the dust, please don't date it!
|
* I would cook dinner, but I can't find the can opener!
|
* I came, I saw, I decided to order take out.
|
* If you don't like my standards of cooking, lower your standards.
|
* A messy kitchen is a happy kitchen, and this kitchen is delirious.
|
* Help keep the kitchen clean - eat out.
|
* Countless numbers of people have eaten in this kitchen and gone on to lead normal lives.
|
* My house was clean last week; too bad you missed it!
