!!Two Ways to Look at Things

A husband and wife are sitting at a table at their high school reunion. The husband keeps staring at a very intoxicated lady swigging her drinks as she sits alone at a nearby table.

The wife asks, "Do you know her?"  The husband sighed, and said "Yes, she's my old girlfriend. I hear that she took to drinking right after we split up all those many years ago. She apparently hasn't been sober since."

"My goodness, said the wife, who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?"

{{i:So you see, there really are two ways to look at everything.}}
