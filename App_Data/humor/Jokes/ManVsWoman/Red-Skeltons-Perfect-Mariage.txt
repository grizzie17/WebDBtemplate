!!Red Skelton's Recipe for the Perfect Marriage

^{{picture RedSkeltonFaces.jpg}}

* Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant, have a little beverage, good food and companionship. 
{{i:She goes on Tuesdays, I go on Fridays.}}
|
* We also sleep in separate beds. 
{{i:Hers is in California and mine is in Texas.}}
|
* I take my wife everywhere ... but she keeps finding her way back. 
|
* I asked my wife where she wanted to go for our anniversary.
"Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!" she said. 
{{i:So I suggested the kitchen.}}
|
* We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops. 
|
* She has an electric blender, electric toaster and electric bread maker. She said "There are too many gadgets and no place to sit down!".
{{i:So I bought her an electric chair.}}
|
* My wife told me the car wasn't running well because there was water in the carburetor. 
I asked where the car was; she told me "In the lake".
|
* She got a mud pack and looked great for two days. 
{{i:Then the mud fell off.}}
|
* She ran after the garbage truck, yelling "Am I too late for the garbage?" The driver said "No, jump in!" 
|
* Remember: Marriage is the number one cause of divorce. 
|
* I married Miss Right...
I just didn't know her first name was {{i:Always}}.
|
* I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months. 
{{i:I don't like to interrupt her.}}
|
* The last fight was my fault though. 
My wife asked "What's on the TV?" I said "Dust!"
