!!The Difference Between Men And Women

!!!Handles / Titles

If Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara go out for lunch, they will call each other Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara.

If Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Fat Boy, Godzilla, Peanut-Head and Scrappy.


!!!Eating Out

When the bill arrives, Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom will each throw in $10, even though it's only for $32.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back.

When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.



!!!Money

A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he needs.

A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't need but it's on sale.



!!!Bathrooms

A man has six items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Marriott.

The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 337. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.



!!!Arguments

A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.



!!!Cats

Women love cats.

Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men throw things at cats.



!!!Dressing Up

A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, and get the mail.

A man may put on shoes for weddings and funerals.



!!!Natural

Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed.

Women somehow deteriorate during the night.



!!!Offspring

Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and romances, best friends, favorite foods, secret fears and hopes and dreams.

A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.



!!!Thought for the Day

Any married man should forget his mistakes. There's no use in two people remembering the same thing.
