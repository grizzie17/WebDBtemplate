!!Mom's Night Out

My Parents had not been out together in quite some time.  One Saturday evening, as Mom was busy at the kitchen sink, Dad stepped up behind her.

"Would you like to go out, girl?" he asked.

Without turning around from the sink, Mom replied, "Yes, I'd love to."

They had a wonderful night, spending hours dancing and sipping wine together.

It wasn't until the end of the evening that curiosity got the best of Mom. She asked Dad why he had volunteered to take her out without her prodding him.

He sheepishly looked at her and said that his question had actually been directed toward the family dog, which had been lying near Mom's feet on the kitchen floor.
