!!Bubba's Graduation

Bubba had been going to  Texas A & M {{i:(You may substitute Alabama, Auburn or Tennessee as appropriate)}} for 11 years and just couldn't Graduate. One day, the dean of students calls Bubba in to his office and says, "Bubba, we're going to give you the opportunity to Graduate.  In a month, at half time of the homecoming football game, we are going to bring you out on the field and ask you one question.  If you get it right, you get your degree. If you get it wrong, you have to go home without it and not come back."

Bubba agreed to this and ran off to start studying. He studied night and day for a month. Finally the day came.  It was a special day with homecoming and Bubba's shindig. The whole stadium was packed with Aggie {{i:(Same option to substitute here)}} students and alumni, all waiting to see how Bubba would do.  The dean stepped up and said, "Bubba, are you ready for your Question?"  Bubba said he was.

The dean said, "Bubba, what is 3 X 3?"

Bubba thought about it for about ten minutes and then finally stepped up to the microphone and said, "9?"

Before the dean could respond, thousands of the A & M {{i:(Once again)}} students, Alumni and faculty jumped up and yelled

... "GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE!!"
