Two good ol' boys in a Tennessee trailer park are sitting around talking one afternoon over a cold beer after getting off of work at their local plant.

After a while the 1st guy says to the 2nd, "If'n I was to sneak over to your trailer Saturday & make love to your wife while you was off huntin' and she got pregnant and had a baby, would that make us kin?"

The 2nd guy crooks his head sideways for a minute, scratches it, and squints his eyes, thinking real hard about the question. Finally, he says,  "Well, I don't know about kin, but it would make us even."
