!!Why Rednecks can't be paramedics

A couple of rednecks are out in the woods hunting when one of them grabs his chest and falls to the ground. He doesn't seem to be breathing his eyes are rolled back in his head.

The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911.

He gasps to the operator, "I think Bubba is dead! What should I do?" The operator, in a calm soothing voice says, "Just take it easy and follow my instructions.. First, let's make sure he's dead."

There is a silence... and then a shot is heard. The guy's voice comes back on the line, "Okay, now what?"
