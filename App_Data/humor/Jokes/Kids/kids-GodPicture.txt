A youngster devoted an entire rainy indoors afternoon to a drawing he was doing with varicolored crayons. His mother finally looked over his shoulder, and, puzzled, asked "Who's that you're drawing, son?"

The son answered, "God."

"Don't be silly," reproved the mother. "Nobody knows what God looks like."

Not even pausing in his task, the son announced calmly, "They will when I'm finished!"
