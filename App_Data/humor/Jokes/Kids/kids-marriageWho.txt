{{b:How do you decide who to Marry?}}

* You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming.

* No person really decides before they grow up who they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later who you're stuck with.
