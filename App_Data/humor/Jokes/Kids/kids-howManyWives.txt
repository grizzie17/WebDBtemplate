A little boy was attending his first wedding.  

After the service, his cousin asked him, "How many women can a man marry?"

"Sixteen," the boy responded. 

His cousin was amazed that he had an answer so quickly.  "How do you know that?"

"Easy," the little boy said. "All you have to do is add it up, like the Bishop said, 4 better, 4 worse, 4 richer, 4 poorer."
