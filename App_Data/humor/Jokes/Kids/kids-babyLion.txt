I was sitting with my four-year-old son one night sometime around Christmas. We were reading a book on the nativity story.

When we came to the part where Mary laid the baby Jesus in the manger, I said, "And here's the baby lyin' in the manger."

My son stopped a moment then turned to me with the most quizzical look on his face and said, "But mommy, where's the baby lion?"
