A little girl, dressed in her Sunday best, was running as fast as she could, trying not to be late for Bible class.  As she ran she prayed,
"Dear Lord, please don't let me be late!
Dear Lord, please don't let me be  late!"
As she was running and praying, she tripped on a curb and fell, getting her clothes dirty and tearing her dress.  She got up, brushed herself off, and started running again.  As she ran she once again began to pray, 
"Dear Lord, please don't let me be late...But please don't shove me either!"
