{{i:In his address of 19 September 1796, given as he prepared to leave office, President George Washington spoke about the importance of morality to the country's well-being:}}

Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Morality are indispensable supports. ... And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. ... Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a Nation with its virtue?
