!!The Preacher and His Teenage Son

An old country preacher had a teenage son, and it was getting time the boy should give some thought to choosing a profession.  Like many young men his age, the boy didn't really know what he wanted to do, and he didn't seem too concerned about it.   

One day, while the boy was away at school, his father decided to try an experiment. He went into the boy's room and placed on his study table four objects. 

1. A bible.
2. A silver dollar.
3. A bottle of whisky.
4. And a Playboy magazine. 

"I'll just hide behind the door," the old preacher said to himself. "When he comes home from school today, I'll see which object he picks up.  If it's the bible, he's going to be a preacher like me, and what a blessing that would be!  If he picks up the dollar, he's going to be a business man, and that would be okay, too.  But if he picks up the bottle, he's going to be a no-good drunken bum, and Lord, what a shame that would be.  And worst of all if he picks up that magazine he's going to be a skirt-chasing womanizer."

The old man waited anxiously, and soon heard his son's foot-steps as he entered the house whistling and headed for his room.

The boy tossed his books on the bed, and as he turned to leave the room he spotted the objects on the table.  With curiosity in his eye, he walked over to inspect them.

Finally, he picked up the Bible and placed it under his arm.  He picked up the silver dollar and dropped into his pocket.  He uncorked the bottle and took a big drink, while he admired this month's centerfold.

"Lord have mercy," the old preacher disgustedly whispered. "He's gonna run for Congress."
