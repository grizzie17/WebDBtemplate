I rear-ended a car this morning. So, there we were alongside the road and slowly the other driver got out of his car. (You know how sometimes you just get sooooo stressed and little things just seem funny?) Yeah, well I couldn't believe it... he was a DWARF!!

He stormed over to my car, looked up at me, and shouted. "I AM NOT HAPPY!!"

So, I looked down at him and said, "Well, then which one are you?"

And then the fight started...
