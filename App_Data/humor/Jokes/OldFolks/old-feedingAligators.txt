An elderly man in Florida had owned a large farm for several years.  He had a large pond in the back, fixed up nice; picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some orange and grapefruit trees.  The pond was properly shaped and fixed up for swimming when it was built.  
 
One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over.  He grabbed a five gallon bucket to bring back some fruit.  As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee.  As he came closer he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. 
   
When the women were aware of his presence they all went to the deep end.  One of the women shouted to him, "We're not coming out until you leave!"    
   
The old man frowned, "I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked."  Holding the bucket up he said, "I'm here to feed the alligators."   
   
Old men can still think fast.
