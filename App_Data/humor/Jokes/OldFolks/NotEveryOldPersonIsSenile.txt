!!Not Every Old Person is Senile

No one believes seniors ... Everyone thinks they are senile.

An Elderly couple were celebrating their sixtieth anniversary.  The couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had moved back to their old neighbourhood after they retired.

Holding hands they walked back to their old school.  It was not locked, so they entered and found the old desk they'd shared, where Andy had carved "I love you, Sally."

On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armoured  car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up, but not sure what to do with it, they took it home.  There, she counted the money -- fifty-thousand dollars.

Andy said, "We've got to give it back."  Sally said, "Finders keepers." She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic.

The next day, two FBI men were canvassing the neighbourhood looking for the money, and knocked on the door.  "Pardon me, but did either of you find a bag that fell out of an armoured car yesterday?" Sally said, "No."  Andy said, "She's lying. She hid it up in the attic."

Sally said, "Don't believe him, he's getting senile."  The agents turn to Andy and began to question him.

One says: "Tell us the story from the beginning."

Andy said, "Well, when Sally and I were walking home from school yesterday ..."

The first FBI guy turns to his partner and says, "We're outta here."
