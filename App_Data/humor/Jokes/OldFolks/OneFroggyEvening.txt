{{b:One Froggy Evening}}

An old man was walking in the forest when he heard by his feet a very weak voice. 

He bent down to look and saw that the voice came from a little frog:

"I'm a beautiful, erotic and sensual princess, skilled in all the carnal pleasures of love. An evil queen, envious of my charms, turned me into a frog, but if you kiss me I will once again be a fair maiden, and I will provide you with all the joys and delights of my voluptuous temperament and my ardent lust."

The old man picked up the little frog and put her into his pocket. 

Bewildered, the frog looked out and asked: 

"What, you're not going to kiss me?" 

"Nope," replied the old man. "At my age it's more fun to have a talking frog than a sex maniac."
