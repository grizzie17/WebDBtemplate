{{b:Showdown in the Atlantic }}

{{i:What follows is a transcript of the ACTUAL radio conversation between a U.S. naval ship and Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland:}}

{{i:Canadians:}} Please divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.

{{i:Americans:}} Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the north to avoid a collision. 

{{i:Canadians:}} Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision. 

{{i:Americans:}} This is the Captain of a U.S. Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course. 

{{i:Canadians:}} No. I say again, you divert {{b:YOUR}} course. 

{{i:Americans:}} {{b:This is the Aircraft Carrier U.S.S. Lincoln, the Second-Largest ship in the United States' Atlantic Fleet. We are accompanied by three Destroyers, three Cruisers, and numerous support vessels.  I DEMAND that you change your course 15 degrees North.  I SAY AGAIN, That's ONE FIVE DEGREES North, or Countermeasures will be undertaken to ensure the safety of this ship.}}

{{i:Canadians:}} {{b:This is a lighthouse.}} Your call.
