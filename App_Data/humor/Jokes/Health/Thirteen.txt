!!Thirteen!

I was walking past the mental hospital the other day, and all the patients were shouting, "13... 13... 13... 13."

The fence was too high to see over, but I saw a little gap in the planks and looked through to see what was going on.

Some bastard poked me in the eye with a stick.

Then they all started shouting. "14... 14... 14... 14..."
