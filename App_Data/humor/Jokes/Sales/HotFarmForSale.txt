!!Hot Farm For Sale

A married couple was looking to purchase some property.  An over zealous realtor showed them what could only be described as a totally worn out farm. The land had been worked to death and even the weeds were hardly growing.

The super salesman said, "All this land really needs is a little water, a nice cool breeze and some good people."

"Yeah, I agree," the husband replied.  "But couldn't the same be said of hell?"
