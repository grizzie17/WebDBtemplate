!!Wal*Mart

{{i:Mr. and Mrs. Fenton are retired, and Mrs. Fenton insists her husband go with her to Wal-Mart, but he gets bored with all the shopping trips.  He prefers to get in and get out, but Mrs. Fenton loves to browse.  Here's a letter sent to Mrs. Fenton:}}

Dear Mrs. Fenton, 
During the past six months, your husband has been causing quite a commotion in our store. We cannot tolerate this behavior and may ban both of you from our stores.  We have documented all incidents on our video surveillance equipment. Complaints against Mr. Fenton are listed below.

* June 15: Took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in people's carts when they weren't looking. 
* July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in House wares to go off at 5-minute intervals.
* July 7: Made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the restrooms. 
* July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official tone, 'Code 3' in housewares... and watched what happened. 
* August 4: Went to the Service Desk and asked to put a bag of M&M's on layaway. 
* September 14: Moved a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area. 
* September 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told other shoppers he'd invite them in if they'll bring pillows from the bedding department. 
* September 23: When a clerk asked if he could help Mr. Fenton he began to cry and asked, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' 
* October 4: Looked into the security camera, used it as a mirror and picked his nose. 
* November 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk if he knew where the antidepressants could be found. 
* December 3: Darted around the store suspiciously, loudly humming the "Mission Impossible" theme. 
* December 6: In the auto department, practiced his "Madonna look" using different size funnels. 
* December 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browse through, yelled "PICK ME!" "PICK ME!" 
* December 21: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed the fetal position and screamed "NO ! NO! It's those voices again!"
And last, but not least ...
* December 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile, and then yelled very loudly, "There is no toilet paper in here!"

Regards,
Wal-Mart Super Store
