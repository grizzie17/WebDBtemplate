{{i:Murphy's Corollaries}}

1. Nothing is as easy as it looks. 
2. Everything takes longer than you think. 
3. If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most severe damage will be the one to go wrong.
(Corollary: If there is a worse time for something to go wrong, it will happen then.) 
4. Whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first. 
5. Every solution breeds new problems. 
6. It is impossible to make anything fool-proof because fools are so ingenious.
