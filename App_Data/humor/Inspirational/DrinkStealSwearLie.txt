!!Drink, Steal, Swear & Lie

{{i:I received this from a friend and he has a motto he lives by everyday. He said listen carefully and
Live by these 4 rules: {{b:Drink, Steal, Swear, & Lie}}.}}

I was shaking my head 'no', but he then told me to listen while he explained his four rules. So here they are:

1. {{b:Drink}} from the "everlasting cup" every day.
|
2. {{b:Steal}} a moment to help someone that is in worse shape than you are.
|
3. {{b:Swear}} that you will be a better person today than yesterday.
|
4. And last, but not least, when you {{b:lie}} down at night {{i:Thank God}} you live in America and have freedom.


I am not as good as I should be, I am not as good as I could be. But Thank God I am better than I used to be!



{{i:Trust in the LORD with all thine heart, lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge HIM and HE shall direct thy paths. [Proverbs 3:5-6]}}
