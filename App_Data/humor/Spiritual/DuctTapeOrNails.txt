!!!100 Points

A man dies and goes to heaven. Of course, St. Peter meets him at the Pearly Gates.

St. Peter says, "Here's how it works. You need 100 points to make it into heaven. You tell me all the good things you've done, and I give you a certain number of points for each item, depending on how good it was. When you reach 100 points, you get in." 

"Okay," the man says, "I was married to the same woman for 50 years and never cheated on her, even in my heart." 

"That's wonderful," says St.Peter, "that's worth three points!" 

"Three points?" he says. "Well, I attended church all my life and supported its ministry with my tithe and service."

"Terrific!" says St.Peter.  "That's certainly worth a point." 

"One point!?!!" 

"I started a soup kitchen in my city and worked in a shelter for homeless veterans." 

"Fantastic, that's good for two more points," he says. 

"Two points!?!!" Exasperated, the man cries. "At this rate the only way I'll get into heaven is by the grace of God." 

"Bingo, 100 points!  Come on in!"
