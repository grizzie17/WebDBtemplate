!!CB Radio Chatter

C.B. Radios are extremely useful tools that can help the group riding experience immensely.  They are great for coordinating the group and notifying all of the participants of upcoming turns, lane changes, and most importantly road hazards.  They can also be the source of a lot of fun.

There are two very serious and real dangers that are created by idle chatter on the C.B.  The first is the distraction that this banter causes.  It doesn’t matter how experienced that you {{i:think}} you are, a distraction of any form can become very serious, very quickly.  Please keep your focus on the task of maintaining your line and position in the group formation along with staying aware of hazards.  Which brings us to the second danger of idle chatter on the C.B. -- If the C.B. is being monopolized with chatter and gossip, then it is not available for use to announce road hazards or “sudden” alterations of plans.
