!!'Tis the Season to be Snuffy

Your eyes are watering, your nose is dripping, your congested, your coughing, your sinuses are filled up and your head feels as if it's about to explode.  Yep, this sounds like the perfect time to go jump on a motorcycle and take a long leisurely ride in the country, doesn't it?

It's been said many times over that riding a motorcycle is 90-95% mental.  Do you really, think that you could give the proper amount of attention to road conditions, surrounding traffic, that dog waiting next to the trash cans, and a hundred other cases if you felt the way that I described in the opening paragraph?  I would venture to categorically say no.

So what's my point?  Motorcycle riding is an experience that consumes the complete rider and it requires a complete rider.  If you are feeling under the weather, then my suggestion is to find some medications that will help and then stay home.  If you can't stay home, then climb in your four-wheeled vehicle, preferably with a fresh, healthy driver.  If you don't have anyone else to drive, see if you can find a passenger that will help you look out for the motorcycles.  And don't feel bad about taking the four-wheeler.  It's just until you can get yourself feeling better.

Don't go ride until you can ride with ALL of you.
