!!!Motorcycle Tire Repairs

* Never repair a tire with less than 1/32nd inch (0.8 millimeters) tread remaining. At this tread depth, the tire is worn out and must be replaced.
* Never repair a tire with a puncture larger than 1/4 inch (6.4 millimeters) in diameter. Such tires cannot be properly repaired and must be replaced.
* Repairs of all tires (radial and non-radial) must be of the plug-and-inside-patch type. Using plugs alone on any type of tire is not a safe repair.
* Never repair a tire with a puncture or other damage outside the tread area. Such tires cannot be properly repaired and must be replaced.
* Any tire repair done without removing the tire from the rim is improper.
* Tubes, like tires, should be repaired only by a qualified tire service person.
* Never use a tube as a substitute for a proper repair.
