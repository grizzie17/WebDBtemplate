!!Double Check

!!!Space Cushioning

"Motorcyclists, who have significant room to maneuver while riding within a traffic lane, can use this margin to position themselves for maximum visibility to other motorists with safety and control of the situation." (NAMS, 2001)

!!!Why Double Check?

*About 3/4 of motorcycle accidents involve another motor vehicle.
*Two-thirds of these accidents were caused by the motorist failing to yield the right of way.
*The most common reason given by the motorist is, “I didn’t see the motorcycle.” 

!!!Why don't motorists see Motorcyclists?

*Motorists, for the most part, are unfamiliar with motorcycles.
*Motorists tend to look for and see the familiar - other motorists.
*Motorcycles have a much smaller profile than vehicles; therefore, judging speed and distance of an approaching motorcycle is more difficult. 

!!!Where Are Accidents most likely to occur?

* LEFT TURNS - Over 40% of all motorcycle accidents occur at intersections.
* VEHICLE BLIND SPOT - Motorcyclists are often hidden in a vehicles blind spot or missed in a quick look due to their size. 

EVERYONE SHOULD LOOK TWICE - SAVE A LIFE

!!!WHAT CAN A MOTORIST DO?

* Expect to see motorcyclists.  Look twice!
* Try to anticipate a motorcyclist's movements - be especially cautious at intersections and during lane changes.  "Take a second - Double check!"
* Allow more space between your vehicle an a motorcyclist than you would for another vehicle.  "Ride aware!"
* Be courteous - signal your intentions well in advance. 

Remember - "How many motorcyclists have you seen today?  LOOK TWICE"
