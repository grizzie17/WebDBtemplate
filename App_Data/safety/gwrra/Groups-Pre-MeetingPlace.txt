Meeting Place

Safety of the groups paramount.  So, don't start off on the wrong foot by selecting a meeting place which can have potential hazards.  The meeting place should provide an adequate area so the bikers can line-up in group formation, making it safer to leave as a group.  Upon departure, the group should be able to pull out without having to cross over a lane of traffic.  The meeting place should be on the same side of the road as the direction the group is heading.
