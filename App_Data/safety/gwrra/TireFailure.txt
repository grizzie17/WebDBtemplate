!!Tire Failure

1. The single most important thing you can do to prevent motorcycle tire failure is to always ride on properly inflated tires!
2. The only way to be sure your tires are properly inflated is to measure their air pressure using a good-quality air gauge confirmed to be accurate.
3. Follow the inflation pressure recommendations provided by your motorcycle tires’ manufacturer.
4. Inspect your tires visually before every ride. Look for punctures, cracks, missing tread or any irregularities.
5. Inspect your tire’s valve stems for dry or cracked rubber, bent valve stem components, or missing valve stem caps and rim valve holds, Honda part #42754-MN5-000. Missing rim valve holds can lead to valve stem failure, rapid tire deflation, loss of control, and road rash. Listen for the sound of air leakage.
6. REPEAT: The single most important thing you can do to prevent motorcycle tire failure is to always ride on properly inflated tires!
