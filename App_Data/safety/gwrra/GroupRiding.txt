!!Group Riding:

* The real advantage is safety, a group is easier to see 
* The key is establishing who is going to do what in each situation 
* Ride with riders you trust 
* Avoid the heard instinct, ride your own bike 
* Your safety is your responsibility - don't let the group lead you into trouble 
* Each person must ride within their limits -- not the group's limit 
* Perform pre-ride inspections before you leave -- have a full tank of gas 
* Pick a meeting place large enough for all bikes and in the direction of travel 
* A group leader and tail gunner (sweeper) must be selected for each group 
* No more than 5 bikes per group -- minimum of one quarter mile between groups 
* Demonstrate hand signals and select a CB channel 
* Trikes, trailers and side cars in the rear of each group 
* Know destination, route of travel, tentative rest stops, time and places to stop for meals, weather forecast, formations, speed and emergency procedures 
* Each rider is assigned a position in the group, no passing within the group without permission of the leader 
* Two land road -- ride single file picking safest route, minimum 2 seconds 
* Interstate highway -- ride staggered formation, minimum 2 seconds apart 
* Speed -- should be agreed upon BEFORE leaving, no faster than the slowest rider can safely go 
* Bike problem -- only one bike stops balance of the group goes to safe area for all to stop 
* Roadside (shoulder) stops are very dangerous -- get the group off the road 
* Notify the group well ahead, no sudden changes 
* Never exceed your riding limits for distance, speed, temperature -- anything 
* Don't look behind, 75% of all accidents come from 45 degrees either side of the straight ahead, focus on what is in front -- ahead of your bike 

Riding in a group NEVER changes a biker's responsibilities.  A biker still assumes responsibility for all of his/her actions and what is going on around them.
