!!The Top 20 Rules for Riding

{{i:(Extracted from the Rider Education National Newsletter)}}

*20. The two most useless things to a rider are the braking distance behind you, and nine-tenths of a second ago
*19. Remember... gravity and centrifugal force are not just good ideas. They are laws and are not subject to appeal.
*18. Keep looking around. There's always something you've missed.
*17. Good judgment comes from experience. Unfortunately, the experience usually comes from bad judgment.
*16. In the ongoing battle between objects made of metal, rubber, and fiberglass...going 100+ miles per hour, and the ground going zero miles per hour, the ground has yet to lose. Same holds for cars, large trucks, and animals taller than you. Draws don't count.
*15. If all you can see in your mirrors is sparks and all you can hear is screaming from your passenger, things may not be as they should be.
*14. You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience. The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of luck.
*13. There are two simple rules for riding smoothly and fast in snow and on ice. Unfortunately no one knows what they are.
*12. Always try to keep the number of times you put your side-stand down equal to the number of times you put the side-stand up.
*11. Never let a motorcycle take you somewhere your brain didn't get to three seconds earlier.
*10. You know you've left the sidestand down when all left turn are bad-turns. You know you've left the center-stand down when your in 1st gear at 4000 rpm going no-where.
*9. Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to make all of them yourself.
*8. When in doubt slow down. No one has ever hit something too slow.
*7. The rear wheel is just a big fan on back of the bike used to keep the rider cool and his/her butt relaxed. If going into a corner too fast, slamming on the rear brake causes the "fan" to abruptly stop. When this happens you can actually see the rider start sweating and his/her butt become tense.
*6. The only time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire.
*5. It's always better to be on the sidelines wishing you were on the track, than on the track wishing you were on the sidelines.
*4. Riding isn't dangerous! Crashing is dangerous!
*3. If you push the bars left, the bike goes left. If you push the bars right, the bike goes right. That is, unless you continue pushing the bars all the way, then the bike will go down.
*2. Every ride is optional. 
*1. A "good" ride is one from which you can walk away. A "great" ride is one after which you can use the bike again.
