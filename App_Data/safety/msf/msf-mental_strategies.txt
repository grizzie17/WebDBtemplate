!!Apply effective mental strategies:

* Constantly search the road for changing conditions.
* Give yourself space and time to respond to other motorists’ actions.
* Give other motorists time and space to respond to you.
* Use lane positioning to be seen; ride in the part of a lane where you are most visible.
* Watch for turning vehicles.
* Signal your next move in advance.
* Avoid weaving between lanes.
* Pretend you’re invisible, and ride extra defensively.
* Don't ride when you are tired or under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
* Know and follow the rules of the road.
* Stick to the speed limit.

{{i:Remember: Give yourself space. People driving cars often just don’t see motorcycles. Even when drivers do see you, chances are they’ve never been on a motorcycle and can’t properly judge your speed.}}
