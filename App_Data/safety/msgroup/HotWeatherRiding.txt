!!Cooling down in Hot Weather  

Riding when the temperature is well in excess of 90 degrees can be dangerous to your health. Unless you take care to keep your body temperature under control even rides as short as an hour can result in heat-prostration or even sun-stroke.

Many riders know that if you keep your neck cool, because the large veins that feed your brain are so close to the surface, you greatly diminish these health risks. There are many popular devices that are simple and effective in this regard.

One more way to handle high heat - those of you that wear skull-caps (helmet liners) can simply saturate them with water before putting them on. This works very well indeed, for about half an hour.

Further, of course, simply pouring water on your shirt helps a great deal - again, because it provides a huge area over which evaporation takes place.

While on the subject let me remind you that your wet shirt is not the only large area that evaporates - all of your exposed skin does the same. 

Thus, you NEED to DRINK lots of fluids too!!!  {{i:The fluid you need to drink is water.}}
