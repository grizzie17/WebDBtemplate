!!Changing Lanes:

A lesson that is not quite emphasized enough in MSF class is that your mirrors only say NO. That is, if you see a problem in your mirrors, they are telling you NOT to move into that problem. 

If they do not show you a problem that is not the same as them saying, YES, make your move. Head checks every time.
