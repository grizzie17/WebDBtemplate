!!Cold Weather Starting

For those that have been riding more than a year it probably is not new news, so consider it just a reminder.

Regardless of whether or not you have an indicator that says your bike is in neutral, ALWAYS hold your clutch all the way in when starting your bike.

Next, and this one can save you pain and damage to the bike: ALWAYS hold your front brake (HARD) before dropping the bike into gear - even when your clutch is being held all the way in.

Because you have a wet clutch, cold weather causes your oil to thicken and your clutch/flywheel tend to stick together after sitting for several hours with the engine off. Because of this, merely holding your clutch lever fully engaged is no assurance that when you drop into gear the bike will not jump forward unless you are firmly braked.
