If it's shiny or black, ride a different track. Just because you are in staggered formation does NOT mean that you have to stay in your track. There is a whole lane at your disposal without encroaching on the traffic rights of other motorists. You ride staggered to give you maneuvering room in case you need it. Rather than ride over a patch of shiny or unusually black surface, assume you need it.
