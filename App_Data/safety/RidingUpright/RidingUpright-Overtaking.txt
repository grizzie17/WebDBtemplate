!!OVERTAKING

You are riding down a single lane highway, the vehicle in front of you is traveling just below the speed limit and you make the decision to overtake. A short distance ahead is a T-intersection. To the right on approach to this intersection a vehicle turns left into your lane from the intersection - you are now in a collision path with this vehicle and a crash is imminent.

!!!Where did it go wrong?

It is important that you have good clear vision through intersections. On approaching where vision is restricted it is advisable to hang back before overtaking. When a driver is turning left into a street they are more likely to be looking to their right as they turn. If you are travelling on the wrong side of the road at the approach to the intersection, a crash may be difficult to avoid.
