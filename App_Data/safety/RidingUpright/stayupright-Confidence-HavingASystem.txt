!!Confidence - Having a System

I can still remember my first ride on a motorcycle on the Public Streets and I was not what you could call relaxed or confident. In fact I think I recall saying to myself "What am I doing out in this jungle?".

Many riders find themselves in this situation even if they have been riding for a week or decades, especially when it's raining and you are in heavy traffic, your gloves are wet, your boots full of water and the road's like an ice rink. I know new riders must frequently ask themselves what they are doing out there. I guess it's natural to be concerned for your own skin when in this situation.

Riding on the street can be risky if your brain is in neutral or if you have decided that motorcycling is your only way to adventure and so become a reckless, thrill seeking mobile weapon! I doubt that there are too many riders with that thought. One of the best ways to help gain confidence and reduce risk is to operate to a {{b:system}}. Looking up the dictionary I found the word "{{b:system}}" means "{{b:a combination of things or parts forming a complex whole}}". Being systematic on a motorcycle means showing or involving a system, method or plan. Having a system will help you gain confidence and should also help eliminate the chance of your making a mistake.

The pilot of an aircraft goes through a systematic check of all instruments on the approach to an airport to eliminate all possible mistakes: riding any motorcycle on the Public Streets should be treated with the same caution to eliminate all hazards. It should be appreciated that the system set out here is basic and must be adjusted by the rider according to the circumstances relating to particular hazards that may occur. Some hazards require fewer features than this example - other hazards require more. I believe that to have a system helps to build {{b:CONFIDENCE}} needed when riding. Who wants to drop a bike - it's embarrassing and painful, not to mention expensive!

Motorcycling gets into your blood when you gain confidence. Riding to a system will help to increase your skills and awareness then you will be more relaxed - after all we should never forget that motorcycling is {{b:FUN}}, especially with {{b:CONFIDENCE}}.
