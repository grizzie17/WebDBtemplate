<h2><a name="top"></a>Simple Text Formatting</h2>
Simple Text Formatting (STF) is designed to provide a method to create very 
readable text when viewed as plain-text and when processed with the 
html-formatter very good looking and readable web-content.&nbsp; Most of STF can 
be done without the use of any kind of meta-tags.&nbsp; Some of the more 
advanced features do require some very simple meta-tags but they are not as 
complex as html and provide even richer content.&nbsp; The primary features of STF
include:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#para">Simple Paragraphs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#lists">Lists</li></a>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="#bullet">Bullet Lists</a></li>
  <li><a href="#numbers">Numbered Lists</a></li>
  <li><a href="#outline">Outline Lists</a></li>
  <li><a href="#indentedblocks">Indented Blocks</a></li>
</ul>
  
  <li><a href="#header">Headers</a></li>
  <li><a href="#rule">Horizontal Rules (Lines)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#link">Web-Site Address Links</a></li>
</ul>
Advanced Features:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#styles">Text Styles</a></li>
	<li><a href="#fonts">Fonts</a></li>
  <li><a href="#pictures">Pictures</a></li>
  <li><a href="#pullquotes">Pull Quotes</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="para"></a>Simple Paragraphs</h3>
<p>The simplest form of STF is creating paragraphs.&nbsp; Paragraphs are 
created by simply providing an empty line between blocks of text.</p>
<%

DIM	sText
sText = _
		"This is a block of text with no embedded returns.  " _
		&	"In other words when the user entered the text they " _
		&	"did not press the ""enter"" key while typing this paragraph." & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"Here is another block of text, again with no embedded returns." & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"And yet another block of text."
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>If an embedded return is found (user pressed &quot;enter&quot; without
producing a blank line) the text following the return will start on a new line
but a new paragraph will not be produced.</p>
<%

sText =	"This is a paragraph with many lines." & vbLF _
		&	"Second line of paragraph" & vbLF _
		&	"Another line after pressing ""enter""" & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"This is another paragraph" & vbLF _
		&	"Yet another line" & vbLF _
		&	"Short line again"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>The following is an example of what the preceding plain-text would be 
formatted as by a web-browser if the STF routines were not used to process the 
text.</p>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output no format" -->
<%
	outputNoFormat sText
%>
<h4>Centered Paragraphs</h4>
<p>You can also create centered paragraphs by prefixing the first line of a
paragraph with a circumflex (&quot;^&quot;).</p>
<%

sText =	"[center]This is a paragraph with many lines that will be centered." & vbLF _
		&	"Second line of paragraph" & vbLF _
		&	"Another line after pressing ""enter""[/center]" & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"[center]This is another paragraph" & vbLF _
		&	"Yet another line" & vbLF _
		&	"Short line again[/center]"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>The circumflex prefix as used for centered-paragraphs is a good example of 
how many of the remaining features of STF are specified.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="lists"></a>Lists</h3>
<p>Lists are special forms of paragraphs.&nbsp; The entire list must be 
delimited by empty lines.&nbsp; Each list-item is a text line that begins with a 
special character or sequence of characters.&nbsp; Each subsequent line (following a return) 
that begins with the special character or sequence is considered the next 
list-item.</p>
<h4><a name="bullet"></a>Bullet Lists</h4>
<p> Bullet lists are created by beginning a line with an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;).&nbsp; 
Each subsequent line (following a return) that begins with an asterisk is 
considered the next point of the bullet list.</p>
<%
sText = "" _
		&	"[list]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the first bulleted point." & vbLF _
		&	"If you press ""enter"" (without a blank line) the following text " _
		&	"will start on a new line but still be part of the same bullet point.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the second bullet point.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the third bullet.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[/list]" & vbLF
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>It is important to note that bullet lists (as well as all other lists) must 
have an empty line before the first list-item. Notice in the following example 
the formatted result is not treated as a bullet list but is simply treated as a single paragraph.</p>
<%
sText = "" _
		&	"The following is a bullet list:" & vbLF _
		&	"[list]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the first bulleted point.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the second bullet point.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the third bullet.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[/list]"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>By adding an empty line before the list the formatting routines can convert 
the asterisk list into a true bullet list.</p>
<%
sText = _
		"The following is a bullet list:" & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"* This is the first bulleted point." & vbLF _
		&	"* This is the second bullet point." & vbLF _
		&	"* This is the third bullet."
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>

<p>Bullet lists can also create nested (indented) lists by specifying more than
one asterisk at the beginning of the line.&nbsp; Each asterisk represents
another level of nesting.&nbsp; As each list is nested the
bullet shape changes. Starting with the first level the bullets are; solid round disc, open circle,
solid square, then the cycle repeats.</p>
<%
sText = "" _
		&	"[list]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the first bulleted point.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the second bullet point.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[list]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is a nested bullet point[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] Second nested point[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[list]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] Third level nested point[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] Third level nested point two[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[/list]" & vbLF _
		&	"[/list]" & vbLF _
		&	"[*] This is the third bullet.[/*]" & vbLF _
		&	"[/list]"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>A special method of representing a bullet list can be specified by starting 
each bullet point with a single dash (&quot;-&quot;).&nbsp; There must not be more than a 
single dash and there must be at least two dash-bullet items.&nbsp; Nested 
(indented) dash-bullet items are not supported.</p>
<%
sText = _
		"-This is the first bulleted point." & vbLF _
		&	"If you press ""enter"" (without a blank line) the following text " _
		&	"will start on a new line but still be part of the same bullet point." & vbLF _
		&	"-This is the second bullet point." & vbLF _
		&	"-This is the third bullet."
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>Bullet lists are delimited by empty lines.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="numbers"></a>Numbered Lists</h4>
<p>Numbered lists are nearly identical to bullet lists with the exception that 
each line begins with a number sign (&quot;#&quot;).</p>
<%
sText = "" _
		&	"[list=1]" & vbLF _
		&	"[li] This is the first numbered point." & vbLF _
		&	"Line after a return.[/li]" & vbLF _
		&	"[li] This is the second number point.[/li]" & vbLF _
		&	"[li] This is the third number.[/li]" & vbLF _
		&	"[/list=1]"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>It is important to note that for &quot;all&quot; numbered lists there must be at least 
two numbered list-items. Notice in the following example that each poorly formed 
numbered item is in a separate paragraph.</p>
<%
sText = "" _
		&	"[list=1]" & vbLF _
		&	"[li] This is a single numbered Point" & vbLF _
		&	"[/li]" & vbLF _

		&	"[/list=1]"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>If you want a blank line separating points of a list separate the lines with 
 
a single vertical-bar (&quot;|&quot;).</p>
<%
sText = "" _
		&	"# This is a single numbered Point" & vbLF _
		&	"|" & vbLF _
		&	"# This is another single numbered point"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>Nested or Indented lists are also supported.&nbsp; As each list is nested the
numbering system changes. The numbering systems are; Arabic
numerals, lowercase letters,  lowercase
Roman numerals, and then remaining nesting is
identical to the bullet lists.</p>
<%
sText =	"" _
		&	"[list=1]" & vbLF _

		&	"[/list=1]"
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText

<p>In addition to  identifying a numbered list with number signs you can create 
a numbered list with numbers.&nbsp; Each number must be delimited with either a 
period ('.') or a close parenthesis (')').</p>
<%
sText =	"1) This is the first numbered point." & vbLF _

<p>A Horizontal Rule is specified by providing a line of dashes.&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
the line contains any characters other than dashes then the line does not

<h2>Advanced Features</h2>
<p>The advanced formatting features of STF use some basic meta-tag like syntax.&nbsp; 
In general the syntax is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{{tagname options <b>:</b> text }}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tagname - is the operation, such as a text style</li>
  <li>options - affects how &quot;tagname&quot; works</li>
  <li>text - what the &quot;tagname&quot; is affecting</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="styles"></a>Text Styles</h3>
<p>You can also specify some more advanced text styles.&nbsp; The entered text
is not quite as obvious but it still is readable and understandable for what you
are trying to accomplish.&nbsp; The text styles include bold, italic, underline,
small, and large.&nbsp; You specify the styled text by surrounding the
text with double braces (&quot;{{&quot;, &quot;}}&quot;) and prefixing the
styled text with a format tag followed by a colon (&quot;:&quot;)</p>
<%
sText =	"This is some [b]Bolded text[/b]." & vbLF _
		&	"This is some [i]Italicized text[/i]." & vbLF _
		&	"This is some [u]Underlined text[/u]." & vbLF _
		&	"And some [large]Large size text[/large]" & vbLF _
		&	"And some [small]Small size text[/small]" & vbLF _
		&	"And some [size=6]Very Big text[/size=6]" & vbLF _
		&	"Some [s]Strike through text[/s]" & vbLF _
		&	"And text with superscript X[sup]2[/sup]" & vbLF _
		&	"And a subscript X[sub]3[/sub]"

<p>It is also possible to use the text styles in combination with each other by
nesting the double braces.</p>
<%
sText =	"This text is [b][i]Bolded and Italicized[/i][/b]." & vbLF _
		&	"[b]Bold, [i]Italicized, [u]Underlined and [large]Big[/large][/u][/i][/b]" & vbLF
%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>Text styles also support specifying colors.</p>
<%
sText = "[b]" _
		&	"[blue]blue[/blue], " _
		&	"[green]green[/green], " _
		&	"[gold]gold[/gold], " _
		&	"[yellow]yellow[/yellow], " _
		&	"[brown]brown[/brown], " _
		&	"[orange]orange[/orange], " _
		&	"[red]red[/red], " _

		&	"[black]black[/black] " _
		&	"[/b]"

<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->

<p>Text styles can be specified with several different names:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;b&quot;, &quot;bold&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;i&quot;, &quot;italic&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;u&quot;, &quot;underline&quot;, &quot;_&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;big&quot;, &quot;large&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;small&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;strike&quot;, &quot;s&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;sup&quot;, &quot;^&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;sub&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;nowrap&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;style&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="fonts"></a>Fonts</h3>
<p>You can also specify font or font-family names in a similar fashion to styles.&nbsp; The 
fonts can include any of the generic-font-names: 
serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, or monospace.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The method of specifying a pull-quote is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{font <i>font-name</i><b>:</b> <i>text to apply 
font</i>}}</p>
<p>In addition to the generic-font-names you may specify any font name.&nbsp; It 
is important to note that if you need to specify a font whose name contains 
spaces you must replace the spaces with underscores (&quot;_&quot;).&nbsp; As an example 
if you were specifying &quot;Cooper Black&quot; the name must be specified as &quot;Cooper_Black&quot;.</p>
<%
sText =	"{{font serif:Some serif text}}" & vbLF _
		&	"{{font sans-serif:and some sans-serif text}}" & vbLF _
		&	"{{font cursive:then some cursive text}}" & vbLF _
		&	"{{font fantasy:and neat Fantasy text}}" & vbLF _
		&	"{{font monospace:Monospaced text}}" & vbLF _
		&	"{{font arial_black:Arial Black text}}" & vbLF _
		&	"{{font cooper_black:Cooper Black text}}" & vbLF

<h3><a name="pictures"></a>Pictures</h3>
<p>You can specify pictures that can be embedded in your text.&nbsp;The picture is
specified similarly to the text styles using double braces (&quot;{{&quot;,
&quot;}}&quot;).&nbsp; The easiest method of specifying a picture is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{{picture <i>some-label</i>}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where the &quot;<i>some-label</i>&quot; is the label that you provided when you 
uploaded the file to the web-server.</p>
<%
sText =	"Some image [img]web-paint[/img] that is embedded in the line." & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"{{picture bear-paw right}} Picture with alignment that will word wrap etc. " _
		&	"Using the align option makes it real easy to embed your pictures into your text." & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"Little picture {{picture bear-paw 20}}" & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"Picture used with web-address Support@GrizzlyWeb.com [[img]email-envelope[/img]]"

%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p>A caption may be specified by providing text following a colon.&nbsp; Caption text may also be
styled.&nbsp; Caption text is not compatible with the &quot;width=percent%&quot;
option.&nbsp; Caption text should not be used with pictures that are associated
with the label of a web-address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{picture some-label <b>:</b> <i>Caption text</i>}}</p>
<p>The available optional arguments are &quot;align&quot;, &quot;border&quot; and
&quot;width&quot;.&nbsp; The following is a description of each.</p>
<ul>
  <li>align=left -- the picture floats to the left margin and text wraps to the
    right</li>
  <li>align=right -- the picture floats to the right margin and text wraps to
    the left</li>
  <li>left -- same as align=left</li>
  <li>right -- same as align=right</li>
  <li>border=<i>number</i> -- specifies the number of pixels to be used for the
    border</li>
  <li>noborder -- specifies that no border should be used (same as border=0)</li>
  <li>width=<i>number</i> -- specifies the width of the picture in pixels</li>
  <li>width=<i>percent%</i> -- specifies the width of the picture as a percent
    of the paragraph width (ignored if a caption is specified)</li>
  <li><i>number</i> -- same as width=<i>number</i></li>
  <li><i>percent%</i> -- same as width=<i>percent%</i></li>
</ul>
<%
sText =	"{{picture dancing-frog align=left:Dancing {{i:Frog}} Cartoon}} " _
		&	"Picture with alignment and caption.  Take note that the word {{i:""Frog""}} is {{i:italicized}} in the caption. " _
		&	"The align option works very well with the caption option." & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"Picture with no border Support@GrizzlyWeb.com [{{picture mailbox noborder}}] used as a web-address"

<p>You may also specify a picture by using one of the terms:
&quot;picture&quot;, &quot;pict&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;img&quot;</p>

<p><b>Please reduce your pictures before uploading them to the web.</b></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="pullquotes"></a>Pull Quotes</h3>
<p>Pull Quotes are used to highlight or emphasize key phrases within your
text.&nbsp;  The method of specifying a pull-quote is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{pullquote<b>:</b> <i>text to be quoted</i>}}</p>
<p>You can also abbreviate pullquote as simply &quot;q&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{q<b>:</b> <i>text to be quoted</i>}}</p>
<%
sText =	"This is some normal text with a [quote]key phrase[/quote] sprinkled in here and there." & vbLF _
		&	vbLF _
		&	"In general you should avoid specifying more than one pull-quote per paragraph. " _
		&	"Limit quotes to [quote]significant facts or important sound-bites[/quote] that people will remember. " _
		&	"After all it doesn't make sense to provide a paragraph and then virtually quote its entire content."

%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->
<%
	outputExample sText
%>
<p> You can also logically un-quote a section of your quoted text.&nbsp; This allows
you to skip a portion of the quoted text to emphasize certain sections.&nbsp;
The unquoted section is represented by an ellipses (&quot;...&quot;) in the
pull-quote.&nbsp; Un-quote is specified by either using the tag &quot;unquote&quot;,
&quot;uq&quot;, or &quot;...&quot;.</p>
<%
sText =	"In general you should avoid specifying more than [quote]one pull-quote per paragraph[unquote]. " _
		&	"Try to[/unquote] limit quotes to significant facts or important sound-bites[/quote] that people will remember. " _
		&	"After all it doesn't make sense to provide a paragraph and then virtually quote its entire content."

%>
<!--webbot bot="PurpleText" preview="Output Example" -->

%>
<p>Pull quotes support the width and align optional arguments that operate
identically to the corresponding picture arguments.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="sidebar"></a>Sidebars</h3>
<p>Sidebars are used to provide additional information in an article or text.&nbsp; 
Sidebars are similar in operation to pull-quotes, but the block of identified 
text is not replicated in the main paragraph.&nbsp; The text only shows up in 
the sidebar block.&nbsp;  The method of specifying a sidebar is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{sidebar<b>:</b> <i>text to be quoted</i>}}</p>
<p>You can also specify a sidebar as &quot;block&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{block<b>:</b> <i>text to be quoted</i>}}</p>
<%
sText =	"This is some normal text with a {{sidebar:key phrase}} sprinkled in here and there." & vbLF _
